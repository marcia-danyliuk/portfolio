      Dear Visitors,<br />
      <br />
      My name is Marta. This is my first portfolio. <br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>I started to be interested in different career path long time ago.</p>
    <p>I did my first steps into this direction in 2022.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Unfortunately, during this time the war in Ukraine started.</p>
    <p>
      One of the most important people in my life was diagnosed with terminal
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>I needed to pause my tries to learn <i>Frontend Development</i>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      During this time, I got a job offer in Poland due to my background in
      <i>Talent Sourcing/Recruiting</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too many responsibilities with caring for myself, family member, and work
      took it's toll. I wanted time for me.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I changed mylife completely, by relocating from Poland to Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding <i>Sourcing/Recruiting</i> opportunity in Switzerland was
      challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lacked the most important skill that closed doors for many
      opportunities: fluency in German, Italian, and French.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b
        >I use all of my power to become <i>Frontend Developer</i>. To follow my
        dream. To study. To get an internship. To get an opportunity in this
        profession.</b
      >
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>To summarize: My name is Marta. I was <i>IT Sourcer/Recruiter</i>.</p>
    <p>
      I am going to talk about my journey into becoming a
      <i>Frontend Developer</i>.
    </p>
